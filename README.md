#PikachuClicky

A clicky memory game created using React with Create React App. The game used 12 different Pikachu images and the goal is to click on each image only once until the player has clicked on all of them. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time and is reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once. The top score is only over written if it is greater than the previous top score. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.
